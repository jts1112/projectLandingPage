         <p class="information-images"> Age</p>
        <p class="hero-secondary-text">The average lifespan of a tiger in the wild is about 11 years. In captivity their lifespan is about 20 to 25 years.</p>

        <img class="information-images" src="" alt="">
        <p class="hero-secondary-text">Most classifications separate the tiger species into six subspecies. These include the Siberian tiger, the Bengal tiger, the Sumatran tiger, the Indo-Chinese tiger, the South China tiger, and the Malayan tiger.</p>

        <img class="information-images"src="" alt="">
        <p class="hero-secondary-text">Tigers eat large prey animals like deer and wild pigs, though they make exceptions for some small animals, including porcupines. After consuming what they can of their prey, tigers hide animal carcasses from scavengers so they can return to them later.</p>

        <img class="information-images" src="" alt="">
        <p class="hero-secondary-text">Tigers can live in a range of environments, including the Siberian taiga, swamps, grasslands, and rainforests. They can be found anywhere from the Russian Far East to parts of North Korea, China, India, and Southwest Asia to the Indonesian island of Sumatra.</p>
